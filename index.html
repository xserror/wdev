<p>We all have an image of self, built up by the accumulated experiences we've had so far in our lives. 
Some might recognize this as the concept of 'past'. 
When you've lived long enough (and lets face it, in this instance it does not have to be very long) your 'past' starts to influence your expectations of what your coming experiences should be and how they should play out. 
Going out on a limb, we'll call this the 'future'.
How the future actually turns out to be compared to your expectations of it, also shapes your image of self. 
Did I do what I wanted to do? 
Did I become the kind of person I set out to? 
Not all of us have set notions about the last one, but it is my guess that it hovers somewhere in the dark recesses of most peoples minds, be it articulated or not.
How we relate to the past also changes as the future is happening, so as our conception of self changes, so do our view of the past and of our past selves.</p>
<p>In philosophical literature the concept of "psychological continuity" is discussed. A very short, and possibly flawed, interpretation of this follows:</p>
<p>While you might feel very different from the person you were 10 years ago, because life has changed you in smaller or bigger ways, these are actually a series of changes. So you are still you, only a different iteration than 10 years ago.
You change a bit at a time, and each bit is still you.
</p>
<p>Sounds reasonable, right?</p>
</br>
<h6>april 24th 2014</h6>
<p>Well, inherently there seems to be some problems with that. 
Let us initially postulate that each change is a small one, 
and that each change takes you away from from whichever arbitrary starting point you choose to measure from. 
Given enough changes, at one point you are so far removed from the starting point that at least some fundamentals have changed. 
How you view certain things, how you you are likely to react, how you anticipate situations, all these are likely to change.
 Leibnitz law posits that if two objects share exactly the same attributes, they are the same object. 
 In fairness, this also applies to spatial and temporal attributes, 
 but we will overlook these, as we cannot reasonably expect a single person to simultaneously exist in the here and now and 
 the past at the same time (at least given our current take on time). 
 The only physical attributes that are of interest to us are the ones that makes us say that a given Average Joe 
 is the same from one year to the other. Even though this weakens Leibnitz law, given our first postulate about changes, 
 it still leaves us with two objects with a differing set of attributes. 
 Even though there is a psychological continuity from one iteration to the next, 
 linking all of them together, there can still be a vast psychological distance between two points. 
 If that distance becomes to large, you might not actually be, strictly speaking, you any more if you have changed so much that your
  behavioural responses, mindset and way of treating new inputs have changed enough. 
  Some people undergo drastic and dramatic events in life, to the point where others who know them well say that he or she is a different person
   after the experience. So in those cases we are able to observe effects of the psychological distance, 
   although we might not realize just how profound this really is. So why is it so hard to accept that this might be the fact for many of us
   on a regular basis? It seems that since the changes are gradual an slow, we don't seem to think of them as game changing, even though
   the cumulative effect might be just that. Might this be because we naturally have a need, or a very strong inclination, to cling to 
   our perceived identities? If I react differently to relevantly similar inputs now than 10 years ago, and those reactions are different enough,
   how can it be that I'm the same psychological entity as the one 10 years ago? How can that be the same self?</p>
    
   <p>Now, there are of course any number of differing factors I have not included here. Some people have the same type of experiences for 
   large parts of their lives, thus resulting in very minor alterations to the self (and thus also in the perceived self), some are
   naturally more resistant to changes than others, and yet others change but not so much that the psychological distance grows to large.
   But I am willing to bet that for quite a few people, who they was are not who they are. Old Heraclitus knew what he was talking about.</p>
